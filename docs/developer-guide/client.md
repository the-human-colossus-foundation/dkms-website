# Clients

Communication with the DKMS network requires a dedicated client. We provide two clients with distinct levels of abstraction:

- [DKMS.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dkms) -- Node-based client enabling direct interactions with the DKMS network.
- [DKMS CLI](https://github.com/THCLab/dkms-bin) -- Command line interface for checking the state of the DKMS network.

## DKMS CLI

DKMS CLI is a command line interface for interacting with the DKMS network. It is a simple tool that allows you to interact with Witnesses and Watchers, create and sign events, and more.


### Installation

The best way to install DKMS CLI is by downloading one of the release from [Release page](https://github.com/THCLab/dkms-bin)

### Usage

#### Create a new identifier


DKMS CLI allows you to create a new identifier and manage thiers KEL's. To do this, see example:

<Asciinema castId="ZE5bclbsAt6Ls1qujdaJxzoC7" />
