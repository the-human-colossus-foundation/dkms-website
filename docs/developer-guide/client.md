# Clients

Communication with the DKMS network requires a dedicated client. We provide two clients with distinct levels of abstraction:

- [DKMS.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dkms) -- Node-based client enabling direct interactions with the DKMS network.
- [DKMS CLI](https://github.com/THCLab/dkms-bin) -- Command line interface for checking the state of the DKMS network.
