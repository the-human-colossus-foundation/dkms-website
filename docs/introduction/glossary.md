# Glossary

- **Ambient Infrastructure**: Ensemble of components (e.g. Witnesses, Watchers,..) and services enabling a DKMS based cryptographically secured environement for decentralised authentication and peer-to-peer interactions
- **DKMS** -- Decentralized Key Management System
- **Gossip** -- A way of disseminating the information among participants in the network.
- **Identifier** -- A sequence of characters used to refer to a digital and unique form of a label. In this project we focus on cryptographically derived identifier from the private/public key pair and anchored into its own KEL.(*see ref [2b]*) 
- **KEL** -- Key Event Log. An authentic provenance log that keeps all the changes of the Identifier in authentic and verifiable way.
- **OOBI** -- Out of Band Introduction. A discoverability mechanism used in DKMS that is `out-of-band` (ie. via QR codes). In concert with Percolation Theory is founded upon the assumption that "everyone knows something and no one knows everything".
- **Witness** -- collaborates with Controller, attestates that information has been seen at a point in time by a third party (the Witness)
- **Watcher** -- collaborates with Controller and serves for its purposes mainly for the validation purposes. Kind-of J.A.R.V.I.S. from Marvel
- **Receipt** -- Witness issued attestation that confirms that information has been seen at a point in time
