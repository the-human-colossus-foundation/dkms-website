# Why DKMS?

DKMS is pivotal in the realm of digital security, offering a
foundational component for constructing robust Digital Public
Infrastructures (DPI). By leveraging DKMS, organizations can
build DPIs that effectively address complex governance
challenges within digital environments. This is crucial as DPIs
rely on secure, scalable, and flexible key management systems
to maintain the integrity and trustworthiness of digital
interactions on a global scale.

One of the key advantages of DKMS over traditional key
management systems is its decentralized nature, which
eliminates single points of failure and reduces the risk of
centralized attacks. This architecture enhances security and
resilience, making DKMS an essential tool for any organization
looking to safeguard sensitive data and communications.
Moreover, DKMS's ability to seamlessly integrate and function
across diverse digital ecosystems (including centralized, federated and
decentralized) allows it to provide a universal solution to security problems,
transcending geographical and jurisdictional boundaries.

By adopting DKMS, organizations can ensure that their digital
infrastructures are not only secure but also adaptable to the
evolving demands of digital governance. This makes DKMS an
indispensable component for anyone aiming to build a safe and
effective DPI, where security and governance are managed with
unprecedented efficiency and reliability.
