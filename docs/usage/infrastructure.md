# Infrastructure

Currently DKMS infrastructure can be setup using Witnesses and Watchers. Both are available as Docker images:

- [ Witness ]( https://hub.docker.com/r/humancolossus/keriox-witness )
- [Watcher]( https://hub.docker.com/r/humancolossus/keriox-watcher )

For sample setup, see [this](https://github.com/THCLab/dkms-demo/blob/main/infrastructure/docker-compose.yml).
