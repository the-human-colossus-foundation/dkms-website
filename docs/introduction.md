# Decentralised Key Management System

Key management refers to the management of cryptographic keys in a cryptosystem, dealing with the generation, exchange, storage, use, crypto-shredding and replacement of keys. It includes cryptographic protocol design, key servers, user procedures, and other relevant protocols.

Decentralised Key Management System (DKMS) provides the libraries necessary for Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) developers to leverage Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI), a fully decentralised identifier system to achieve network interoperability while securing the identifiers.

The quest for decentralised authentication is how a decentralised key management infrastructure, providing Self-certifying Identifier (SCI) issuance underpinned by one-way cryptographic functions, can offer information uniqueness from captured entropy. Furthermore, a decentralised authentication system must be platform-agnostic, with its identifiers interoperable across ecosystems, platforms, and networks.

## What is “Decentralised authentication”?

Data provenance refers to tracing and recording the origin of data and its movement between locations. If digital data is tamper-proof (i.e. provable to have not been corrupted after its creation), it can be assumed authentic. Data authentication focuses on timestamping data inputs at index time, determining each event as factual. That definition also underpins the concept of decentralised authentication, the only difference being that the decentralised version is specific to distributed data ecosystems.

**Answer**: Decentralised authentication

Decentralised authentication describes a key management methodology of cryptographically binding SCIs to an associated log that compiles the history of all uses or changes to the public/private key pair, ensuring verifiable identifier provenance throughout any ambient infrastructure. Immutable ordering guarantees the factual authenticity of the recorded event underpinning any systematic data input. Furthermore, all system identifiers must remain network-agnostic, enabling identifier interoperability within and across any distributed data ecosystem.

Decentralised authentication provides a powerful solution for identifier interoperability, data provenance, data-intensive event streaming, and event sourcing applications.
